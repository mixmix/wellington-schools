Anecdotes:

> Berhampore was the most community minded over the ones we visited. They have a
> pretty active parent board and two seperate fundraising committees (one
> project specific and one short term). They actively recruit but on a no
> obligations basis. All of our sport teams also have 2 parents (1 coach and 1
> manager) and weâ€™ve been asked to attend 3 or 4 different field trips as parent
> support. We have been to a few of the community events so far they usually do
> 2 community events per term.


> We have a weekly newsletter which is on the school website which contains most
> information but our teachers send us an email every Sunday on the plan for the
> week and if they need help with anything


> Other things that help at our school is we have a swimming pool which is open
> every Sunday for community swimming, lots of people hang out in the playground
> after school and the local golf next door has a community dinner first Friday
> of the month. This offers a lot of unplanned and informal opportunities to
> meet people
