# wellington-schools

A map of Wellington Schools which highlights what they're doing in partnership
with whanau and community.

My long-term goal is thriving resilient community where all our kids needs are
met, and they experience first hand the power of taking agency in their lives to
grow the patterns they want to see in the world.

Concretely, I am starting by gathering stories of awesome school-community
partnerships, initiatives. I want us to be inspired, and maybe even support one
another to activation by sharing the details of those patterns that seem to
really shine.


_This repo currently leans "Eastern suburbs" (near where I live), primary age (my
kids). Open to contributions and expanding_
