## Initiatives

Interesting questions to consider for how to record this info:
- what are we missing visibility on? why?
- which group is leading the intiative (i.e. set up the process, plan, are administrating it)?
- what is the difference between staff and school led?
    - I notice many of the initiatives listed here were run by 2 staff (backed by school + other staff)
- the source of an idea is sometimes different than who leads the work... how do we record that?
